# Final Project Proposal

 Overview: I would like to do some type of non-photorealistic
 rendering, specifically painterly rendering or a pen/ink
 conversion of a 2D image into a painted/sketched version of the
 image. I think that this type of project would be very interesting, 
 and somewhat different from the projects we have done in class. I
 enjoy the idea of processing an image file like the first lab, and
 think that there is an artistic component to rendering the image
 in different styles. 

# Course Concepts Used

 This project would potentially use concepts including image processing, 
 lighting and finding normal vectors to surfaces, modifying the 
 greyscale/resolution of the image, and using particle systems to
 define brush strokes of an image.

# Other software Tools

 I may need to use certain image processing helpers from the Magik++
 package as I would like to focus on the rendering of the image 
 rather than its processing. I may also use mathematical helpers such
 as functions of splines to approximate brush strokes and their direction.

# Goals
 
 Short term: gain proficiency in mathematical concepts, particle systems,
 and implement image processing functionality required. 

 Long term: create an image that models a 2D input image with different
 types of painting styles and/or sketch techniques. These models should
 look like realistic paintings and not random sequences of brush strokes. 
 I hope to implement painting styles such as pointalism, expressionism, 
 impressionist, etc. which vary by the size of brush strokes and level of 
 detail that is drawn. 

 Reach: maybe I can apply this to process the images of a video file
 for artistic rendering of a short video and animation purposes. I may
 also add user interaction to select the type of rendering done for any
 given image.

# Assessment

 What would make your project a success?

 My project would be a success if I am able to implement particle systems
 to model an image as a painting or sketch. Ideally, I would be able to 
 render the input image in different styles and in different drawing 
 forms such as painting and sketching. I think this would be along the
 lines of being able to input an image from the internet, selecting a 
 rendering technique, and recieving an output image that modifies the 
 original (or makes a copy) with the requested rendering technique 
 applied. This will allow me to learn more about particle systems, 
 using mathematics and approximations of gradients to construct strokes
 or lines used to draw parts of the image, and combining computer graphics
 with an artistic motivation.
